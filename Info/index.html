					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Henry Tripp Barrick is a 3D artist and game developer currently studying at the 
					University of California, Santa Cruz currently majoring in Anthropology and Arts and 
					Design: Games and Playable Media. Henry works primarily in creating hard surface 3D models and 
					retro-style assets, and has worked in both Godot and Unreal Engine 5. Henry initially began making 3D models  
					while creating mods for video games, which eventually spiraled into developing his own games. 
					He has developed "Ship Game" and worked in a team to develop "Godslayers" and "Patient 004" serving as both a 
					programmer and a 3D artist in a retro style. Henry aims to develop games which are enjoyable, unique, and 
					weird; and which create inspirational systems and environments. </p>
