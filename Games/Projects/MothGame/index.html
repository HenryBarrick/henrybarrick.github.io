					<p>Amotheosis was a project I developed from around mid October to early December 2023 as a part of a club I was associated with

					<p>Almost all of the games assets were environmental, with the Moth being the only non-environmental asset made for the project</p>

					<p>I chose the environment of a very imposing mountain range since most of the environments I had seen using the 
						retro pixel art style at the time all used enclosed or artificial environments, and I wanted to try something different.
