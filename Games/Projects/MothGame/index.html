					<h1>Moth Game</h1>
                    <img class="img1" src="img/tempImage.png">
                    <p>Moth game was the first fully completed solo project I have made. It had a very short development cycle,
						beginning development in early October and finishing development in mid December. As my first attempt at a finished
						game, the scale was intended to be relatively small, mainly being a walking simulator across a large cliffside.
						This decision was made out of an attempt
					</p>
                    </p>
                    <p>Being tasked to do this in a way I was mostly unfamiliar with, coupled with my senior year at University and 
                        being unfamiliar both with making finished games and the Godot engine ment that this came out with some very
                        rough edges. Ultimately this is a project I am not the most proud of but serves as a good basis for improvement
                        in the future. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This game has no publicly avaliable download at the moment. This is because the game was audio balanced to be 
                        played in a public showcase like setting and one of the sound effects is not balanced correctly which may
                        pose a risk to a players ears. In a show of stupidity I did not keep a backup of the finished project before
                        removing it from my hard drive, a mistake I have since learned to not repeat. I still retain a copy of the 
                        finished executable, if you want a copy please email me.
