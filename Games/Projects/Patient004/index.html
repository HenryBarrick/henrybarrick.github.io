                    <p>The final game jam project for my University capstone class. I worked in a team alongside 10 other people to
                        develop this game, serving as the sole programmer and a 3D artist. I was also one of the few implementers 
                        responsible for getting our project from the isolated parts to a finished state.
                    </p>
                    <p>Other post mortem stuff. It was fun to work on. I worked on this whilst developing Moth Game and it really 
                        served as a great way to refine the retro art style for this game. It also gave me a good understanding in 
                        Godot of how the engine works and good ways to work around it.
                    </p>
