					<h2>DEAR EVERYONE</h2>
					<p>I am based, and very cool. I once asked a harvard physicist (who asked to remain anonymous) to find a single flaw 
						about me and they literally couldn't. They gave me back a document that said "This guy is the most powerful gamer in the world
						and is absolutely qualified to lead your company". I am a born leader and advocate on causing psychological harm to as many people as possible.
						I aim to be a notorious criminal like a serial killer or people who use youtube-to-mp3 websites. You can see my work soon when I 
						commission a $50k animated music video involving me and a cartoon character.
