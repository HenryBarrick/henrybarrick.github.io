					<p>It's being developed :omegagigasmile:</p>
                    <p>This project was formed from a few spots (scenes of flashing red lights on water, etc) and came into the 
                        early stages of development roughly 1 week after Moth game was finished and the rest of my finals were done.
                        From the very rough stages of Moth Game I wanted sonmething a lot more polished and more mechanically engaging
                        rather than just being a walking simulator. A horror game was chosen since I felt it meshed well with the 
                        visual style I had envisioned. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Just talk about the game bro.
